<p>In this short blogpost, I’m going to summarize my contributions to the Bambi
library during this Google Summer of Code.</p>
<p>GSoC has been great. I’ve learnt so much during the past weeks. And I’m
obviously eager to keep learning and doing stuff with
<a href="https://bambinos.github.io/bambi">Bambi</a> in the future. The following is a
summary of what we were able to achieve during these time of code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented new default priors <a href="https://github.com/bambinos/bambi/pull/360">#360</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bambinos/bambi/pull/385">#385</a>.</li>
<li>Added new Student-T family <a href="https://github.com/bambinos/bambi/pull/367">#367</a>.</li>
<li>Added new Beta family <a href="https://github.com/bambinos/bambi/pull/368">#368</a>.</li>
<li>Implemented predictions <a href="https://github.com/bambinos/bambi/pull/372">#372</a>.</li>
<li>Improved internal model specification by splitting it into smaller and composable
classes <a href="https://github.com/bambinos/bambi/pull/366">#366</a>.</li>
<li>Added the new Binomial family <a href="https://github.com/bambinos/bambi/pull/386">#386</a>.
This also implied <a href="https://github.com/bambinos/formulae/pull/48">some changes</a>
in its sibling project, <a href="https://bambinos.github.io/formulae">formulae</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This, with many other smaller changes or improvements that you can find
<a href="https://github.com/bambinos/bambi/commits?author=tomicapretto">here</a> were
included in <a href="https://pypi.org/project/bambi/0.6.0/">Bambi 0.6.0</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the items on my original proposal that left to do are
multinomial regression and ordered categorical terms. I’ve started to do some
work on the formulae side, but these features require a more involved work in
Bambi, and thus it is left for future contributions.</p>
<p>To conclude, I want to thank Google for having such an amazing program and
everyone who contributed or helped me to contribute to Bambi. Specially, I want
to recognize the the work of my mentors Ravin Kumar and Thomas Wiecki, and my
director Osvaldo Martin for all the support, feedback, and work
during this program.</p>
