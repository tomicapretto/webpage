<p>I am really happy to participate in this Google Summer of Code season with
<a href="https://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a> to contribute to the <a href="https://bambinos.github.io/bambi">Bambi</a> library.
The coding period ranges from June 7 to August 16, with an intermediate
evaluation taking place between July 12 and July 16.</p>
<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>My project is called <strong>Extend available models and default priors in Bambi</strong>.
The main goal of this project is to add new families of generalized linear
models, such as beta regression, robust linear regression
(i.e. linear model with error following a T-Student distribution)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
as well as multinomial regression. However, this raises a second problem, which
is about default priors distributions.</p>
<p>Default priors in Bambi are limited to the families implemented in the
<a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/glm.html">GLM</a> module in
<a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/">statsmodels</a>, which does not include the families
mentioned above. For this reason, it is first necessary to incorporate
alternative automatic priors so new families work without requiring the user to
manually specify priors.</p>
<p>Therefore, these first weeks of the coding period were centered around
understanding how default priors work on other high-level modeling packages
such as <a href="https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/">brms</a> and
<a href="https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/">rstanarm</a>, how to translate their ideas
into <a href="https://docs.pymc.io/">PyMC3</a> code, and finally how to implement everything
within Bambi.</p>

<h2>Alternative default priors</h2>
<p>Currently, Bambi uses maximum likelihood estimates in the construction of its default
priors. There are two limitations associated with this approach. First, current
default priors don’t exist whenever uniquely identifiable maximum likelihood
estimates don’t exist (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; n\)</span> or complete separation scenarios).
Secondly, these estimates are obtained via the GLM module in statsmodels, which
means default priors can only be obtained for families made available in statsmodels.</p>
<p>Based on the available documentation and simulations I’ve done, I decided to
implement alternative default priors that are much like the
<a href="https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/priors.html">default priors in rstanarm</a>.
These priors aim to be weakly-informative in most scenarios and do not depend on
maximum likelihood estimates. Their documentation is excellent and it was a
great guide for my implementation.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bambinos/bambi/pull/360">This</a> is the PR where I implement
alternative default priors inspired on rstanarm default priors. In addition,
I also implement LKJ prior for the correlation matrices of group-specific effects.</p>

<h3>How to invoke alternative default priors</h3>
<p>The <code>Model()</code> class has gained one new argument, <code>automatic_priors</code>, that can
be equal to <code>"default"</code> to use Bambi’s default method, or <code>"rstanarm"</code> to use
the alternative implementation<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>model = Model(&quot;y ~ x + z&quot;, data, automatic_priors=&quot;rstanarm&quot;)</code></pre>

<div id="how-to-use-lkj-priors-for-correlation-matrices-of-group-specific-effects" class="section level3">
<h3>How to use LKJ priors for correlation matrices of group-specific effects</h3>
<p>Group-specific effects can now have non-independent priors. Instead of using
independent normal distributions, we can use a multivariate normal distribution
whose correlation matrix has an LKJ prior distribution. This distribution
depends on a parameter <span class="math inline">\(\eta &gt; 0\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\eta=1\)</span>, the LJK prior is jointly uniform
over all correlation matrices of the same dimension. If <span class="math inline">\(\eta &gt;1\)</span> increases,
the mode of the distribution is the identity matrix. The larger the value of
<span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> the more sharply peaked the density is at the identity matrix.</p>
<p><code>Model</code> has an argument <code>priors_cor</code> where we can pass a dictionary to indicate
which groups are going to have a LKJ prior. The keys of the dictionary are
the names of the groups, and the values are the values for <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the following model, we have a varying intercept and varying slope for
the groups given by <code>group</code>. These varying effects have a multivariate normal
prior whose covariance matrix depends on a correlation matrix that has a
LKJ hyperprior with <span class="math inline">\(\eta=1\)</span>.</p>

<!-- ### Challenges when implementing alternative default priors -->
<!-- rstanarm's [documentation on default priors](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/priors.html)  -->
<!-- is vast and rich and hence it would be pointless to replicate that here.  -->
<!-- In this section I'm just going to highlight some key points about how their  -->
<!-- defaults are similar or different to current default priors in Bambi and what -->
<!-- challenges that carried when implementing new alternatives for Bambi. -->
<!-- In essence, rstanarm's default priors are similar default priors in Bambi. -->
<!-- There is an extensive use of Normal priors for regression coefficients and  -->
<!-- right-skewed distributions for auxiliary parameters such as the residual standard  -->
<!-- deviation for Gaussian models, shape for gamma, reciprocal dispersion for negative binomial, etc. -->
<!-- But there are two important differences. The first, rstanarm computes parameters -->
<!-- for the priors in a much simpler way. This usually involves standard deviations -->
<!-- which are always available. The second, the priors for the group-specific terms -->
<!-- in rstanarm are based on a multivariate Normal distribution with a -->
<!-- LKJ prior the correlation matrix, while Bambi uses independent Normal priors. -->
<!-- #### Common-level regression coefficients -->
<!-- In both cases we have that the priors for common regression coefficients are -->
<!-- independent normal distributions centered at 0. However, the differ in how they -->
<!-- compute the standard deviation of the prior. -->
<!-- ```{r, echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- data.frame( -->
<!--   library = c("rstanarm", "Bambi"), -->
<!--   name = c("Normal", "Normal"), -->
<!--   mean = c("0", "0"), -->
<!--   sd = c("$2.5 \\cdot s_y/s_x$", "Complex dependency on ML estimates") -->
<!-- ) %>% -->
<!--   kable( -->
<!--     col.names = c("Library", "Distribution", "$\\mu$", "$\\sigma$"), -->
<!--     align = "c", -->
<!--   ) %>% -->
<!--   kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- For the rstanarm prior we have that  -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- s_y = -->
<!-- \begin{cases} -->
<!-- \text{sd}(y) & \text{if } \:\: {\tt family=gaussian(link)}, \\ -->
<!-- 1 & \text{otherwise}. -->
<!-- \end{cases} -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- and $s_x$ is simply the standard deviation of the predictor $x$. -->
<!-- On the other hand, with the excepsion of Gaussian linear regression,  -->
<!-- there's no closed form expression of the standard deviation for these priors in Bambi. -->
<!-- The whole derivation can be found in the paper  -->
<!-- [Statistical details of the default priors in the Bambi library](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01201). -->
<!-- #### Intercept -->
<!-- Both rstanarm and Bambi use a Gaussian prior for the intercept. The computation of the  -->
<!-- mean and standard deviation of this distribution depends on the model at hand. -->
<!-- In the case of Gaussian linear regression, the situation is similar to the -->
<!-- previous comparison. Both priors are normal and centered at the same value, -->
<!-- the mean of the response. They again differ in how they compute  -->
<!-- the standard deviation of that normal distribution. rstanarm uses $2.5 s_y$ and -->
<!-- Bambi uses a function of the variance of the other priors and the predictor data. -->
<!-- For other non-Gaussian models, rstanarm uses a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation -->
<!-- of $2.5$, while Bambi uses a mean and a standard deviation that are a function -->
<!-- of the MLE for an intercept-only model. -->
<!-- #### Auxiliary parameters -->
<!-- Both libraries use right-skewed distributions for the default prior on  -->
<!-- auxiliary parameters (residual standard deviation for -->
<!-- Gaussian, shape for gamma, reciprocal dispersion for negative binomial, etc.) -->
<!-- rstanarm uses an exponential distribution with rate $1 / s_y$ and Bambi uses a  -->
<!-- Half Student's T distribution with $\nu=4$ and $\sigma=s_y$ for Gaussian -->
<!-- models, and a Half Cauchy distribution with a scale of 1 for non-Gaussian models. -->
<!-- #### Group-level regression coefficients -->
<!-- The main difference in the prior for the group-level effects is that  -->
<!-- **Bambi uses independent priors, while rstanarm does not**. -->
<!-- In Bambi, we have priors of the form -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- b_{j} \sim \text{Normal} \left(0, \sigma_b\right) -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- with hyperpriors -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \sigma_b \sim \text{HalfNormal} (\tau) -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- where $\tau$ represents the standard deviation of the hyperprior. -->
<!-- On the other hand, rstanarm puts a multivariate Normal distribution on the  -->
<!-- prior for all the varying effects of a given group. -->
<!-- Instead of placing independent priors on each $b_j$, it places a multivariate  -->
<!-- Normal prior on the vector $\boldsymbol{b}$, which allows for correlated  -->
<!-- group-specific effects. -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \boldsymbol{b} \sim \text{MvNormal}\left(\boldsymbol{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma} \right) -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- In practice, the prior is not set on $\Sigma$. Instead, it is set on the -->
<!-- correlation matrix $\Omega$, and use the following decomposition to recover the -->
<!-- covariance matrix -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \Sigma = \text{diag}(\sigma_b) \ \Omega \ \text{diag}(\sigma_b)  -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- We use an LKJ prior for the correlation matrix -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \Omega \sim \text{LKJ}(\eta), \ \  \eta > 0 -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- If $\eta = 1$ (our default choice), the prior is jointly uniform over all correlation matrices of the same dimension as $\Omega$. If $\eta > 1$, then the mode of the distribution is the identity matrix. The larger the value of $\eta$ the more sharply peaked the density is at the identity matrix -->
<!-- #### Cholesky decomposition -->
<!-- For efficiency and numerical stability, the correlation matrix $\Omega$ can be parametrized by its (lower-triangular) Cholesky factor $L$, which can be seen as the square root of $\Omega$ -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \boldsymbol{L}\boldsymbol{L^T} = \Omega = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & \rho_{u_0, u_1} \\ \rho_{u_0, u_1} & 1 \end{pmatrix}  -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- If $\boldsymbol{Z}_{\text{uncorr}}$ is a $2\times n$ matrix where the rows are 2 samples from uncorrelated random variables, then -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{split} -->
<!--     \boldsymbol{Z}_{\text{corr}} & = -->
<!--     \begin{pmatrix} \sigma_{u_0} & 0 \\ 0 & \sigma_{u_1} \end{pmatrix}  -->
<!--     \boldsymbol{L} -->
<!--     \boldsymbol{Z}_{\text{uncorr}} \\ -->
<!--     & = \text{diag}(\sigma_u) \boldsymbol{L} \boldsymbol{Z}_{\text{uncorr}}      -->
<!-- \end{split} -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Then $\boldsymbol{Z}_{\text{corr}}$, of shape $(2, n)$, contains a sample of size $n$ of two correlated variables with the desired variances $\sigma_{u_0}^2$, $\sigma_{u_1}^2$, and correlation $\rho_{u_0, u_1}$. -->
<!-- rstanarm and Bambi use normal priors centered at 0 for the group-level -->
<!-- regression coefficients. The main difference is that **Bambi uses independent -->
<!-- priors, while rstanarm does not**. In rstanarm the prior for varying effects -->
<!-- is a multivariate normal prior whose covariance matrix depends on an LKJ prior  -->
<!-- for the correlation matrix. Here I am ommiting some details on how the diagonal of the  -->

These two distributions are not members of the exponential family so using them
as the distribution of the random component does not result in a generalized
linear model in a strict sense. But I would usually refer to them as GLMs since
the linear predictor, link function, and random component properties are still present.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
