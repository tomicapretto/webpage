I am a PhD student in Statistics. I am full-time dedicated to study and research thanks to a Doctoral Fellowship by CONICET (Argentina). My place of work is at [IMASL](https://sanluis.conicet.gov.ar/imasl/) in San Luis, Argentina. 

I've always felt curiosity about so many things, that I could not pick only one. So I studied Statistics^[Needless to say I felt very attracted by math and working with a computer]. At that time I felt that something like statistics would give me the chance to work (and learn) with different problems from different fields and ,consequently, I could chose to specialize in a particular field later in my career, or not.

Nowadays, I am not only very happy to have chosen what I chose, but also eager to keep learning. Hopefully, one day I will be able to contribute with my share to the scientific community and return a piece of what I have been given.
